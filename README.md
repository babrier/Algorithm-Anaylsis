# Algorithm-Anaylsis
This program reads in a file of numbers and outputs a csv of the time it takes for certain algorithm to run organized by collumns.
The algorithms measured are sorting a radom array of numbers of random sizes. It is important to note that the two functions of the program
running the algorithms and catching the time have sub parts. In addition to algorithm's total time to get at certain point the time difference 
between points is measured albeit crudely but it works. Will try to optimize this part of the project using pointers in an array sometime in the future.
